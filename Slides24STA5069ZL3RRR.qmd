# Introduction

**Multivariate regression**

- Correlate a set of dependent variables with a set of independent variables.
  - For example:
    - Modelling the relationship between a set of economic indicators and the GDP growth rate.
    - Modelling the relationship between a set of psychological tests and measures of intelligence.
  - The dependent variables may be correlated with each other, and the indepdent variables may or may not be fixed.

**Reduced rank regression**

- A general framework that includes multivariate regression, principal component regression, and canonical correlation analysis as special cases.
